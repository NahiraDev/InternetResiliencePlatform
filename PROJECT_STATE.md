## Current implementation gate

- **Current implementation baseline:** Phases 94–150 modules and phase documents exist on main under `packages/resilience-runtime/src/{traffic,telemetry-plane,control-security,fleet,intelligence,dataplane,control-api,governance,scale}` with tests. Each is PARTIAL pending exact-SHA CI evidence and external runtime evidence. Phase 93 and earlier baselines are unchanged. ResilienceRuntime remains the sole production mutation authority.
- **Current main HEAD inspected (2026-11-02):** `765569723d68d7ad3e3535680d13d3797718d698` (merge of PR #454: Linux network-namespace end-to-end chain verification). Previous documented SHAs were stale.
- **Issue #12 progress:** The Phase 1–38 evidence register is incomplete: Phases 1–15 are mapped; Phases 16–38 still need evidence reconstruction. Historical paths and test-count records for Phases 39–78 do not establish phase acceptance on the current SHA. Those phases remain PARTIAL unless a separately documented external blocker applies, pending phase-specific acceptance verification and fresh exact-SHA CI evidence.
- **Current open issues (authoritative tracker):** #254 (Linux Client runtime wiring), #272 (EPIC: Autonomous Network Superplatform — Full-System Reconstruction & Completion), #284 (Workstream: Full Verification, CI/CD, Deployment & Final Evidence), #323 (Final External Validation Gate — Remote CI, Linux Runtime Soak & Release Evidence), #410/#412 (durable stores / auth / PostgreSQL — P0), #413 (reconcile project state), #420 (CodeQL workflow). Open draft PR #455 advances Linux measurements and recoverable autonomous runtime integration.
- **Phase 77 status:** implementation is complete and merged on `main`; the safety/rollback/recovery kernel is available from `@irp/resilience-runtime`.
- **Phase 78 status:** the bounded closed-loop controller is implemented and present on `main`.
- **Phase 79 status:** NetworkIntent model, lifecycle transitions, effective-window evaluation, autonomy levels and dedicated tests are implemented and present on `main` in `packages/core/src/intent.ts` and `intent.test.ts`. Exported from the core barrel.
- **Phase 80 status:** Intent API & Ingestion is implemented on `main` in `apps/api/src/intent-api.ts` (authenticated routes for create/list/get/commands, Idempotency-Key, in-memory and database stores, ownership isolation). Tests in `intent-api.test.ts`. No network mutation from the API boundary.
- **Phase 81 status:** Intent Translation / Compilation is implemented on `main` in `packages/resilience-runtime/src/intent/compiler.ts` (`compileNetworkIntent`, `isCompiledIntentEffective`). Pure, deterministic, side-effect free. Tests present.
- **Phase 82 status:** Intent-scoped Policy Decision & Enforcement is implemented on `main` via `packages/resilience-runtime/src/intent/governance.ts` and autonomy gates in arbitration. Admission decisions, stale rejection, mode-gated mutationAllowed. Tests present. Broader declarative policy language remains later roadmap work.
- **Phase 83 status:** Policy Conflict Resolution implementation present in `arbitration.ts` (arbitrateIntents, InMemoryIntentStore, PostgresIntentStore). Dedicated unit tests added covering no-conflict, priority supersession, version supersession, stale exclusion and store recording. Scopes overlap now requires matching key+value. Disposition PARTIAL pending CI evidence on current SHA.
- **Phase 92 status:** regression evidence for fabric health/freshness signals, observe-only intent drift detection, and re-selection through existing fabric.select boundary merged via PR #415. Disposition PARTIAL pending exact-SHA CI on owning package tests and full continuous assurance.
- **Release state:** GitHub Releases `v0.2.0` and `v0.2.1` are developer-preview/prerelease evidence, not production certification. Production certification remains open. Current main SHA is `765569723d68d7ad3e3535680d13d3797718d698`; exact-SHA Release Gate evidence must be verified before any stronger release claim.
- **Phase 71 is a separate release-evidence gate:** it does not block architecture implementation in Phases 72–92, but it must not be represented as certified until its evidence exists.
- **Phase 93 status:** advanced route ranking, bounded compiled-intent routing preferences, fail-closed validation, and selection audit evidence are implemented in `packages/resilience-runtime/src/fabric.ts`, with regression coverage in `phase-93-advanced-routing.test.ts`. Disposition PARTIAL pending exact-SHA CI and external runtime evidence. No new runtime authority was introduced.
- **Phases 94–150:** phase documents and corresponding modules exist on main. All modules are additive, pure or injected-clock, advisory, and reach the network only through `PrivilegedMutationBoundary`; data-plane enforcement requires a governed transaction id. Disposition PARTIAL pending exact-SHA CI, review and external runtime evidence; no new runtime authority was introduced and `ResilienceRuntime` remains the sole production mutation authority.
- **Linux primary device:** PR #454 merged real-kernel netns end-to-end chain test (observation through commit/rollback). Draft PR #455 wires measurements, destination verification, route recovery and scheduler into the Linux Full Client.

## Phase 79–83 summary

Phases 79–83 establish the intent model, API ingestion boundary, pure compilation to CompiledIntent, intent-scoped admission/enforcement, and deterministic multi-intent conflict resolution (priority/version supersession, overlapping scope detection) without introducing a second control plane. Downstream phases must consume these contracts.

## Phase 71 certification prerequisites

The Phase 71 gate is limited to the release/distribution contract defined by `docs/phases/phase-71.md`. Remaining production certification (device smoke, regional validation, signing, security sign-off) is tracked in open issues and `docs/release/RELEASE_GATE_ROADMAP.md`.

## Product objective

IRP's long-term objective is a safe, observable and policy-governed Internet control plane that can continuously measure network conditions, diagnose failures, select and apply bounded changes, verify the result, recover from failure and explain decisions across supported clients and network providers.

## Architecture invariants (unchanged)

- ResilienceRuntime remains the canonical runtime authority.
- Never restore NetworkAutopilot as a parallel production control plane.
- No competing authorities for runtime state, policy, decisions, safety, mutation, execution, verification, recovery, intent, or orchestration.
